Phobos is a Smalltalk framework that helps to create platform independent desktop applications using XULRunner.
It uses Mozilla XULRunner for rendering of GUI components.

Phobos has component-based architecture inspired by Seaside.

For basic information about XULRunner applications structure and distribution see this documentation

## Features
